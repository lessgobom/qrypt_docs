## 🔒 Quantum-Resistant Hashing Algorithms  
$QRYPT employs **post-quantum cryptography** to ensure security:  

1. **Lattice-Based Cryptography** 🔗  
   - Resistant to Shor’s algorithm for breaking RSA/ECC.  

2. **Hash-Based Cryptography** 🔐  
   - Immune to quantum decryption attacks.  

3. **Multivariate Polynomial Cryptography** 🧩  
   - Adds complexity for additional security layers.  

## 🛡 Security Framework:  
- **PQC Standards (NIST-Compliant)** 📜.  
- **Immutable Records on Blockchain** 🧱.  
- **Layered Security Model** 🔄.
